Church Source is an open source church management web application.  The 
application is in heavy development right now and just focusing on a 
child check in/out system.  However, eventually I hope to add other 
features to give churches a free, open source alternative to expensive, 
propriety church management applications.

Future possible features:

* Volunteer Management
* Donation/Financial Tracking
* Mailing Management

Church Source is written using the Django framework and can be installed
on your own server using standard technologies such as MySQL, Postgres, 
Apache, etc.
